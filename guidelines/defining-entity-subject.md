# 2.26 Defining entity subject

## Patient

This label provides information that the concept is related to the patient.
For example: “The patient has hypertension”. In this sentence, the “patient” becomes the subject, and the information can be perceived that hypertension is associated with the patient.

## Family member

This label provides information that the concept is related to the family members of the patient.
For example: “The patient’s mother has diabetes”. In this sentence, “mother” becomes the family member and it can be said that diabetes is associated with the patient’s mother.

## Other

This label provides information that the entity is related to any other individual except for the family members of the patient or the patient itself.
For example: “The patient’s friend has myocardial infarction”. In this case, “friend” is annotated as “Other” and it can be inferred that myocardial infarction is associated with the friend.
