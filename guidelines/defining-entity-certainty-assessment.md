For example: “The patient has hypertension and is on diuretics.” In this example, “hypertension” is likely and the patient is taking “diuretics” which also indicates that it is likely.</p><h2><a class="h" name="Somewhat-likely" href="#Somewhat-likely"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="somewhat-likely" href="#somewhat-likely"><span></span></a>Somewhat likely</h2><p>A somewhat likely assessment indicates the entities are present but are not accurate and valid. For example: “The wound of the patient appears to be granulating.” In this example, the phrase “appears to be” is somewhat likely as it is not confirmed evidence.</p><h2><a class="h" name="Unlikely" href="#Unlikely"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="unlikely" href="#unlikely"><span></span></a>Unlikely</h2><p>An unlikely assessment indicates the medical entities are not present. For example: “The patient does not have vomiting and nausea.” In this example, evidence of “vomiting” and “ nausea” is not present in the medical record.</p><h2><a class="h" name="Somewhat-unlikely" href="#Somewhat-unlikely"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="somewhat-unlikely" href="#somewhat-unlikely"><span></span></a>Somewhat unlikely</h2><p>A somewhat unlikely certainty indicates the entities are not totally absent but are present in insignificant amounts. For example: “The patient’s wound abscess was resolving.” In this example, “resolving” is a somewhat unlikely word which means that the wound abscess is not treated completely and hence cannot be marked as somewhat unlikely.</p><h2><a class="h" name="Uncertain" href="#Uncertain"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="uncertain" href="#uncertain"><span></span></a>Uncertain</h2><p>Uncertainty indicates the state of doubt to determine. It is the situation in which something is not known or not certain. For example: “The doctor was unable to diagnose the cancer.” In this example, “unable to diagnose” indicates uncertainty.</p><h2><a class="h" name="Conditional" href="#Conditional"><span></span></a><a class="h" name="conditional" href="#conditional"><span></span></a>Conditional</h2><p>Conditional indicates hypothetical situations and their consequences. For example: “The doctor said that the patient should also come back if he develops pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms.” In this example, “if he develops” is conditional.</p></div></div></div><!-- default customFooter --><footer class="Site-footer"><div class="Footer"><span class="Footer-poweredBy">Powered by <a href="https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gitiles/">Gitiles</a>| <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy</a></span><div class="Footer-links"></div></div></footer></body></html>
