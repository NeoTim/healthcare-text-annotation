# Defining entity certainty assessment

## Likely

A context assessment of the entities confirmed and present in the patient’s medical record.
For example: “The patient has hypertension and is on diuretics.” In this example, “hypertension” is likely and the patient is taking “diuretics” which also indicates that it is likely.

## Somewhat likely

A somewhat likely assessment indicates the entities are present but are not accurate and valid.
For example: “The wound of the patient appears to be granulating.” In this example, the phrase “appears to be” is somewhat likely as it is not confirmed evidence.

## Unlikely

An unlikely assessment indicates the medical entities are not present.
For example: “The patient does not have vomiting and nausea.” In this example, evidence of “vomiting” and “ nausea” is not present in the medical record.

## Somewhat unlikely

A somewhat unlikely certainty indicates the entities are not totally absent but are present in insignificant amounts.
For example: “The patient’s wound abscess was resolving.” In this example, “resolving” is a somewhat unlikely word which means that the wound abscess is not treated completely and hence cannot be marked as somewhat unlikely.

## Uncertain

Uncertainty indicates the state of doubt to determine. It is the situation in which something is not known or not certain.
For example: “The doctor was unable to diagnose the cancer.” In this example, “unable to diagnose” indicates uncertainty.

## Conditional

Conditional indicates hypothetical situations and their consequences.
For example: “The doctor said that the patient should also come back if he develops pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms.” In this example, “if he develops” is conditional.
