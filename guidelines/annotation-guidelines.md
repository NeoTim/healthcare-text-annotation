# 2. Annotation guidelines

## 2.1 Introduction

Medical annotations capture a structured representation of knowledge stored in unstructured text. The task of mapping text to structured knowledge is done with the end goal of feeding the annotations into a machine learning algorithm that learns how to automatically extract the medical knowledge contained in the text. The guidelines defined below establish an annotation standard to be followed by human annotators. By following a standard methodology for data annotation, we expect to obtain high-quality medical annotations.
